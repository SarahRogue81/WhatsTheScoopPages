= What's The Scoop?™ Pages

this is a link:https://getpelican.com/[Pelican] theme with a link:https://picocss.com/[Pico CSS] UI

this theme displays pages as links in the menu bar

it displays the main index page (Home) and the other pages are listed in a menu bar in the top navbar

there can be a Blog menu item (page) listing each article on that page. Pelican `tags` and `catgories` are *not* currently supported but may be if there's enough demand for them. me personally, i do not need them rn

in the future, i hope to add the ability to have a static _*Contact Me*_ page

enjoy!
